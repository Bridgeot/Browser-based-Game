### PseudoCode
- The game will consist of a single player
- Player will see a 4x4 board (16 circles) displayed automatically
- All circles will have a facedown (no picture) and faceup (picture) state
- When the game starts: 
    - All circles will begin in the facedown state
- Player will click on a circle 1-16, that circle will go faceup
- Player will then click on a different circle 1-16, that circle will also go faceup
    - If the pic on circle 1 = the pic on circle 2, both cards will remain faceup
    - If the pic on circle 1 is not = the pic on circle 2, both cards will return facedown
- The player wins if:
    - All circles enter the faceup state
- The player loses if:
    - All circles do not enter the faceup state
