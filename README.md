## How to Play
- The game consists of a single player
- Player will see a 4x4 board (16 circles) displayed automatically
- All circles will have a facedown and faceup state
- When the game starts: 
    - All circles will begin in the facedown state
    - A 1 minute countdown timer will begin automatically
- Player will need to click on any circle to begin playing
    - The selected circle will return faceup upon being clicked
- Player will then need to click on another circle
    - The selected circle cannot be one that is already faceup
- If the picture on the first selected circle matches the picture on the second selected circle, then both circles will remain situated faceup
- If the picture on the first selected circle doesn't match the picture on the second selected circle, then both circles will return facedown and a "TRY AGAIN" message will populate on the screen
- The player wins if:
    - All circles have entered the faceup state and the countdown timer is > 0
    - A "YOU WIN!!!" message populates on the screen
- The player loses if:
    - All circles have not entered the faceup state and the countdown timer is < 0
    - A "YOU LOSE..." message populates on the screen
- Whether the player wins or loses, the game will automatically shuffle the circles and restart from the beginning after a short period of time
